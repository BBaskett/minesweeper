# Minesweeper

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Start

**Start > Programs > Minesweeper**

### Instructions

- You start with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.

- Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighboring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.

- To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click.
